/**
 * A request message that passes details of the previously negotiated transaction that the transferor wishes to novate as well as describing the identity and roles of each party. As the same message is sent to both the transferee and remaining party it must contain the complete description of the underlying transaction (rather than just a reference) as the transferee will not have record of it.
